## Installation

To run this project, you need to have the following libraries installed:

- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- scikit-learn

## Usage

Upload Files: Upload the necessary files containing training and testing data.
Preprocess Data: Deserialize the data and prepare it for training and testing.
Visualize Data: Plot the tasks using a custom color scheme.
Train the Model: Train a Decision Tree Classifier on the training data.
Evaluate the Model: Evaluate the model's performance using accuracy.

## File Upload and Preprocessing

The initial part of the code handles file uploads and data preprocessing:
File Upload: Upload the necessary files containing the training and testing data.
Data Access: Access the content of the uploaded files.
Deserialization: Convert the serialized data into usable Python data structures.

## Visualization

Functions to visualize tasks using matplotlib:

Color Mapping: Define a color scheme for plotting.
Task Plotting: Plot the train and test pairs of a specified task.

## Training the Model

Model Initialization: Create an instance of the Decision Tree Classifier.
Model Training: Train the model using the training data.

## Evaluating the Model

Making Predictions: Use the trained model to make predictions on the test data.
Calculating Accuracy: Compute the accuracy of the model's predictions.

## Results

Evaluation Accuracy: 0.864
Validation Loss: 1.8
